#### Tell me about your proudest professional achievement.  It can also be a personal or school project.  

One of my biggest achievements, is getting my motorcycle license and owning a motorcycle. Being 4'9 you start to wonder if there are just a lot of things you can't do. After a while I started to believe it. I had to remember that this was something that I wanted since I was a kid and I couldn't keep pushing it aside. Being able to accomplish this goal, has made me feel like I can accomplish anything. This has me very determined to try and reach other goals. 



#### Tell me about something you have read recently that you would recommend and why. (Can be a Github Repo, Article, Blog, Book, etc) 


I would recommend anyone to look up the benefits of positive thinking either in a book or an article. In a world that has so much going on it, it's hard to beleive that anything will go right, when it seems like everything can just go wrong. Having a positive mindset is better for your overall health and it helps with stress relief. When you are an overthinker, you tihnk about everything that could go good and bad. Sometimes the amount of bad out weighs the good and it can cause some feelings of dread.

#### How would you explain to your grandmother what Availity does?


I would tell me grandmother that Availity is like the postal service, You want to send a letter to someone. In this case the letter is a claim being sent from the provider to an insurance company. You submit the letter to the postal service, or in this case,  Availity. The Postal Servive(Availity) checks the envelope, address, return information, stamp, etc. Then the postal service (Availity) sends that off to who you want, lets say the insurance company. The insurance comapny gets the letter and reads it, then composes a response. The insurance company then sends it back through the same postal service. The postal service (Availity) gives you the response.
