#### Tell me about your proudest professional achievement. It can also be a personal or school project.  

One of my most significant achievements is getting my motorcycle license and owning a motorcycle. Being 4'9, you start to wonder if there are just a lot of things you can't do. After a while, I began to believe it. I had to remember that this was something that I had wanted since I was a kid, and I couldn't keep pushing it aside. Accomplishing this goal has made me feel like I can achieve anything. Getting my motorcycle has made me very determined to try and reach other goals. 



#### Tell me about something you have read recently that you would recommend and why. (Can be a Github Repo, Article, Blog, Book, etc.) 


I would recommend anyone to look up the benefits of positive thinking either in a book or an article. In a world that has so much going on it, it's hard to believe that anything will go right when it seems like everything can go wrong. Having a positive mindset is better for your overall health, and it helps with stress relief. When you are an overthinker, you think about everything that could go good and bad. Sometimes the amount of bad outweighs the good, and it can cause some feelings of dread.

#### How would you explain to your grandmother what Availity does?


I would tell my grandmother that Availity is like the postal service. You want to send a letter to someone. In this case, the letter is a claim being sent from the provider to an insurance company. You submit the letter to the postal service, or in this case,  Availity. The Postal Service(Availity) checks the envelope, address, return information, stamp, etc. Then the postal service (Availity) sends that off to who you want, let's say the insurance company. The insurance company gets the letter, reads it, and then composes a response. The insurance company then sends it back through the same postal service. Again, the postal service (Availity) gives you the answer.

Coding Exercises 

1. Coding exercise: You are tasked to write a checker that validates the parentheses of a LISP code. Write a program (in Java or JavaScript) that takes in a string as an input and returns true if all the parentheses in the string are correctly closed and nested.

2. Coding exercise from a frontend perspective: Healthcare providers request to be part of the Availity system. Using React framework, create a registration user interface so healthcare providers can electronically join Availity. The following data points should be collected:
First and Last Name
NPI number
Business Address
Telephone Number
Email address

3. Coding exercise:  Availity receives enrollment files from various benefits management and enrollment solutions (I.e., HR platforms, payroll platforms). Most of these files are typically in EDI format. However, there are some files in CSV format. For the files in CSV format, write a program in a language that seems appropriate to you that will read the file's content and separate enrollees by the insurance company in its file. Additionally, sort the contents of each file by last and first name (ascending). Lastly, if there are duplicate User Ids for the same Insurance Company, only the record with the highest version should be included. The following data points are included in the file:
User Id (string)
First and Last Name (string)
Version (integer)
Insurance Company (string)
